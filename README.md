# Authgear sample for React Native

This repo demonstrates how to add authentication to an React Native app using Authgear.

## Project setup

### Create Free Authgear Account
1. Goto [https://portal.authgear.com](https://portal.authgear.com) and create a free account (or login to your existing account).

2. Then navigate to Applications and create a new client application of type Native App.

### Configuration

Download/clone the code from this repo then update the configuration.

The project needs to be configured with your Authgear client application's **Endpoint** and **Client ID** in order for the authentication flow to work.

To do this, create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project then copy and paste the content of `.env.template` to it. 

Add the values for your own Authgear client application's Client ID and Endpoint in the corresponding key.

To run this example app, add the following URI to your Authgear client application's Authorized Redirect URI:

- `com.authgear.example.rn://host/path`

To test the app on iOS or Android, run the following commands:
**Install dependencies**
```
npm install
(cd ios && pod install)
```
**Run on iOS**
```
npm run ios
```
**Run on Android**
```
npm run android
```

## What is Authgear?
